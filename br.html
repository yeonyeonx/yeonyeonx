                <p>Written more than a century ago, the stories are relevant and the character is fascinating, even by modern standards. It seems that this was the beginning of that kind of thing that gave rise to many others. This is why this book has managed to remain a favorite even after so many years. Sherlock Holmes is a fascinatingly complex anti-hero kind of character, and his investigations are the kind of thing that just makes you want to follow along for the ride whereas Watson is pretty much the avatar for the reader. The stories are intricate and often devious, and truly only a very great Consulting Detective would be able to crack any of them. </p>    
            </div>
            <div id="p2">
                <p>Doyle's writing is deceptively descriptive and evocative, while reading simply and quickly; it draws one inexorably into each story. Doyle broke free of the purely good protagonist and high moral plot to explore the bad elements of society. Women (some a product of the era and others complex), Opium dens, corruption, social status etc. are all explored, giving it a depth that still makes it enjoyable today. Some of the writing is dated but it is certainly still enjoyable and significant today. We are very familiar with this type of story now--a detective figuring out a mystery--but Conan Doyle was literally inventing the genre.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="p3">
                <p>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is like a window to the past, and they give me a romanticized taste of what life was like back then. Holmes and Watson as characters are portrayed very nicely and it feels just like I’m hanging out with them. How the characters interacted and the variety of people they encountered through their work was very interesting.  The speech is very different from how people speak/write/think today, and the story telling is at a very different pace, but I really enjoy these differences. I often find the prose to be quite beautiful, and the dialogue is eloquent and thoughtful in a way that I admire and enjoy. Conan Doyle also reveals interesting class and educational differences in his characters through dialogue. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="p4">
                <p>I think most of the plots in the stories are quite interesting. I like being confronted with a mystery, then following the evidence with Holmes and Watson, and then getting the reveal at the end. Usually, the crucial bits of information have been placed in front of the reader, so we have all the clues that Holmes does, but are we, the readers, able to sift through them and identify the crucial ones and solve the mystery? I love following the intricate observations of Holmes being stitched together to form larger conclusions. As Conan Doyle repeatedly writes, these conclusions seem like they are magic tricks and come out of nowhere when they are revealed at the end, but when Holmes explains the many detailed observations that they are based on, they make perfect sense. That said, the craft and intrigue of the stories are really commendable. </p>

                <p>While I want to keep on raving about how brilliant the book was, not everyone might consider it good enough. It is undeniable that the stories are quite dry. The stories drag on for a long time and might uninterest the readers. It feels like the pace of the plot is diluted by the sheer quantity of included description of the environment and so it seems to be dragged on for too long. They're not going to be as fast-paced as modern adaptations for the screen. But if you can down-hyper yourself for a while, the slower, thoughtful rhythms are worthwhile, and more in keeping with the nature of deduction. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="p6">
                <p>While some might say that the stories are hyped up so much because they are classics and the readers don’t really care about the slow plot, I’d like to argue that the slow pace of the plot is completely deliberate. The story wants us to try to find the relevant clues in everything. I personally find them paced just right for short stories as someone who reads mostly fantasy/sci-fi novels. The thing is, we’re supposed to be thinking about the mystery as we read, so it wouldn't make sense if we never even had a chance to breathe while reading the story. There is an astonishing level of detail in all of the works and it shouldn’t be overlooked. This is the main reason why only Harry Potter has ever rivaled Sherlock Holmes in terms of a literary character's sheer popularity.</p>

            <div id="p7">
                <p>When it comes to Sherlock Holmes, we're talking about a character that had a massive, public funeral when he died. The outrage was so immense, Doyle had to bring him back. He is still one of the most iconic figures today and for the time, a character with significant depth. I think many who are not readily familiar with the works, do not realize just how human Holmes is portrayed. This book still remains a classic to book lovers and in this current pop culture of super hero craze, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes stories gives a very super hero feel to me.</p>
